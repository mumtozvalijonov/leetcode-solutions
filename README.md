# LeetCode Solutions

A multi-language repository containing LeetCode problem solutions implemented in different programming languages.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by programming language, with each language having its own dedicated folder:

```
├── golang/          # Go solutions
├── rust/            # Rust solutions
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Languages

### Go (`golang/`)
- Solutions implemented in Go
- Each problem in its own directory with `solution.go`, `solution_test.go`, and `README.md`
- Run with `go run` and test with `go test`

### Rust (`rust/`)
- Solutions implemented in Rust
- Cargo workspace for managing dependencies
- Each solution as a separate module

## Contributing

When adding solutions:

1. Choose the appropriate language directory
2. Follow the established naming convention: `{problem_number}_{problem_name}/`
3. Include comprehensive tests
4. Add time/space complexity analysis
5. Document your approach in the problem's README

## Getting Started

Navigate to the language-specific directory and follow the instructions in that folder's README for setup and running solutions.
